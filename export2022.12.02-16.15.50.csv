It follows a non-contact based screening test which is very easy to apply being non-invasive and simply carried out within the boundaries of home so that the medical testing centers are not over flooded with patients and there is an overwhelming pressure because of maintenance of those patients with shortage of adequate infrastructure facilities. The dataset used in this study has been derived from the Coswara database which comprises of around 160 infected and 480 healthy individuals. Therefore, Artificial Intelligence based machine learning classifiers were used as an alternative means of diagnosis. Logistic regression (LR), K- Nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machines (SVM), decision tree algorithms were used as classifiers in the proposed work. The results of this study show that the SVM classifier turned out to be the best in comparing among the COVID-19 and non COVID- 19 coughs with area under receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.98. The novelty in the proposed work includes the collection of dry cough samples which would aid in preliminary diagnosis of the infection. This form of classification can also be implemented in a smart phone after performance evaluation from medical authorities.","","978-1-6654-1272-8","10.1109/ICICCS51141.2021.9432324","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9432324","Cough sounds;COVID-19;Diagnosis;Classification;Machine learning","COVID-19;Support vector machines;Performance evaluation;Machine learning algorithms;Machine learning;Receivers;Medical diagnostic imaging","artificial intelligence;data mining;decision trees;diseases;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;patient diagnosis;pattern classification;regression analysis;support vector machines","dry cough samples;nonCOVID- 19 coughs;SVM classifier;decision tree algorithms;Artificial Intelligence based machine learning classifiers;480 healthy individuals;160 infected individuals;adequate infrastructure facilities;medical testing centers;noncontact based screening test;healthy coughs;nonCOVID-19;COVID-19 coughs;COVID-19 classification;machine learning algorithms;cough sounds;preliminary diagnosis","","10","","15","IEEE","26 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The data consisted of a collection of audio samples collected from different sources including dry, wet, whooping and COVID-19 coughs. Unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques were used to reveal the underlying structure of the data, described by dissimilarity spaces constructed from pair-wise dynamic time warping measures derived from the original sound measurements. Intrinsic dimensionality, nonlinear mappings to low-dimensional spaces and visual cluster assessment techniques allowed a representation of the cough types distribution. Supervised classification techniques were used to obtain models identifying cough classes and high performance classifiers were obtained for most of them, including COVID-19.

Machine learning models have been proposed as an alternative to biomedical testing. Cough has been identified by the World Health Organization as one of the symptoms of COVID-19 disease. In this study, the success performance of the positive case situation with machine learning was examined using the COUGHVID dataset with cough voice recordings.

In the ensemble learning model, features were used as independent variables and a value of 0.65 AUC-ROC was reached. In addition to these performance-enhancing changes, since the acoustic properties of male and female cough sounds are different, the training of persons was carried out separately from each other, and AUC-ROC values of 0.70 for females and 0.68 for males were obtained.

Therefore, a moderate, rapid, but also readily available method for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is essential. Several initiatives have been made to use smartphone-collected sounds and coughs to build machine learning algorithms that can categories and discriminate COVID-19 sounds with healthy tissue. The majority of prior studies used sounds like breathing or coughing to train their analyzers as well as get impressive outcomes. In order to carry out this significant investigation, we used this Coswara dataset, which contains recordings of nine distinct sound varieties of the COVID-19 state of cough, breathing, and speech. COVID-19 could be diagnosed more accurately using trained models on a variety of audio instead of a specific model trained on cough alone. This work examines the potential prospect of using machine learning techniques to enhance the identification of COVID-19 in such an initial and non-invasive manner through the monitoring of audio sounds. The XGBoost outperforms existing benchmark classification algorithms and achieves 92% accuracy with all sounds. Vowel/e/sound random forest with 98.36% was determined to be among the most effective, and the vowel/e/can also evaluated for the purpose of detecting compared to the other vowels; the impact of COVID-19 on sound quality is more precise.","","978-1-6654-5436-0","10.1109/ICEMIS56295.2022.9914391","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9914391","Covidl9;Cough Sounds;Voice analysis;Vowel sounds and Machine learning Algorithms","COVID-19;Industries;Machine learning algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Recording;Medical diagnosis;Biomedical monitoring","audio signal processing;diseases;epidemics;learning (artificial intelligence);medical diagnostic computing;patient diagnosis;pattern classification;smart phones","machine learning framework;covid detection;cough sounds;COVID-19 diagnosis;smartphone-collected sounds;Coswara dataset;audio sound monitoring;XGBoost;COVID-19 sound classification","","","","46","IEEE","13 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent COVID-19 diagnosis procedure, PCR testing is applied to the samples taken from the patients and a quarantine period is applied to the patient until the test results are received. As a complement to PCR tests and for faster diagnosis, thin-section lung computed tomography (CT) imaging is used in COVID-19 patients. In this study, it is aimed to develop a method that is as reliable as CT, and compared to CT, less risky, more accessible, and less costly for the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. For this purpose, first speech and cough sounds from the oral, laryngeal and thoracic regions of COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals were obtained with the multi-channel voice recording system we proposed, the obtained data were processed with machine learning methods and their accuracies in COVID-19 diagnosis were presented comparatively. In our study, the best results were obtained with the features extracted from the cough sounds taken from the oral region.","2165-0608","978-1-6654-5092-8","10.1109/SIU55565.2022.9864842","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9864842","COVID-19;Speech Processing;Telediagnosis;E-Health;Classification;Signal Processing;Artificial Intelligence","COVID-19;Computed tomography;Lung;Imaging;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Recording","bioacoustics;biomedical measurement;computerised tomography;diseases;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);lung;medical disorders;medical image processing;medical signal processing;patient diagnosis;pneumodynamics;signal classification","PCR tests;faster diagnosis;thin-section lung computed tomography imaging;CT;COVID-19 patients;COVID-19 disease;oral regions;laryngeal regions;thoracic regions;machine learning methods;lung involvements;lung involvement condition;recent COVID-19 diagnosis procedure;PCR testing","","","","0","IEEE","29 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

COVID-19 may manifest with different severity in different people, however, it predominantly affects respiratory system. Symptoms may vary from sore throat and cough to shortness of breath and damaged lungs. This work focusses on developing a smart system for early detection of COVID-19 based on cough sounds and machine learning algorithms. Such a system would be easily accessible and may provide initial screening for detection of COVID-19. Moreover, cough sounds may be recorded by the person on smartphone avoiding the need for visiting a hospital or testing facility and getting exposed to the disease during the pandeamic. First, the duration of cough sound is determined in the recorded audio signal using thresholding. Then, statistical features are extracted for cough sound and normalized. Finally, the performance of 10 different machine learning algorithms are compared for automatic detection of COVID-19. The proposed stacked ensemble of machine learning models yields the best performance, with an accuracy of 79.86% and area under region of convergence curve of 0.797 for cough sounds of new patients.","","978-1-6654-0118-0","10.1109/ICSSIT53264.2022.9716373","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9716373","COVID-19;cough sound;machine learning;stacking ensemble;healthcare","COVID-19;Radio frequency;Support vector machines;Machine learning algorithms;Stacking;Feature extraction;Acoustics","audio signal processing;diseases;learning (artificial intelligence);lung;medical computing;patient diagnosis;pattern classification;pneumodynamics","sore throat;cough sound;10 different machine learning algorithms;COVID-19 detection;COVID-19 pandeamic","","","","15","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, a fast and reliable additional solution using recordings of cough, breathing and speech data for preliminary screening may help alleviate these issues. Objective: This scoping review explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology aims to detect COVID-19 disease by using cough, breathing and speech recordings, as reported in the literature. Here, we describe and summarize attributes of the identified AI techniques and datasets used for their implementation. Methods: A scoping review was conducted following the guidelines of PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews). Electronic databases (Google Scholar, Science Direct, and IEEE Xplore) were searched between 1st April 2020 and 1st August 2021. Terms were selected based on the target intervention (i.e. AI), the target disease (i.e., COVID-19) and acoustic correlates of the disease (i.e. speech, breathing and cough). A narrative approach was used to summarize the extracted data. Results: 21 studies and 8 Apps out of the 83 retrieved studies met the inclusion criteria. Half of the publications and Apps were from the USA. The most prominent AI architecture used was a convolutional neural network, followed by a recurrent neural network. AI models were mainly trained, tested and run on websites and personal computers, rather than on phone apps. More than half of the included studies reported area-under-the-curve performance of greater than 0.90 on symptomatic and negative datasets while one study achieved 100% sensitivity in predicting asymptomatic COVID-19 for cough-, breathing- or speech-based acoustic features. Conclusions: The included studies show that AI has the potential to help detect COVID-19 using cough, breathing and speech samples. However, the proposed methods have not been tested clinically, understood neurophysiologicallly, nor validated with broad training and testing datasets.","2644-1276","","10.1109/OJEMB.2022.3143688","European Regional Development Fund ERDF(grant numbers:20/COV/0225); Science Foundation Ireland(grant numbers:13/RC/2073, 13/RC/2094_P2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9713955","COVID-19;Artificial Intelligence;Machine Learning;Cough;Speech Signals;Acoustics;Breathing","Artificial intelligence;COVID-19;Feature extraction;Data mining;Machine learning algorithms;Hospitals;Computer architecture","","","","","","","CCBY","14 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Audio recordings of coughing individuals are one of the sources that can help in the pre-screening of COVID-19 patients. This research focuses on quantitative analysis of covid cough classification using audio recordings of coughing individuals. For analysis, we used three different publicly available datasets i.e., COUGHVID, NoCoCoDa, and a self-collected dataset through a web application. We observed that wet cough has more correlation with covid cough as opposed to dry cough. However, the classification model trained with wet and dry coughs, both, has similar test performance as that of the model trained with wet cough samples only.

According to recent studies, one of the main symptoms of COVID-19 is coughing. The goal of this research effort is to develop a method for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 by detecting cough during recorded conversations. The method is composed of five main modules: sound extraction, sound feature extraction, cough detection, cough classification, and COVID-19 diagnosis. The method extracts relevant features from the audio signal and then uses machine learning and deep learning models, like SVM, KNN, and RNN, to classify them, which can successfully diagnose COVID-19 from audio recordings. Our method has relatively high accuracy when dealing with completely unfamiliar cough samples. When the training set and the test set are from two different databases, it still achieves an accuracy of 81.25% (AUC of 0.79).

The pandemic situation is not yet under control as the virus tends to evolve and develop mutations. This further complicates the development of machine learning or AI models that can automatically detect the disease in the general public. However, researchers worldwide have been putting their incredible efforts into devising mechanisms that help analyze and control the pandemic situation. Many prediction models have been developed to predict COVID-19 infection risk that helps in mitigating the burden on the healthcare system. These models help the medical staff, especially when healthcare resources are limited. As a contribution to society’s well-being, this research work deploys a machine learning prediction model that predicts COVID-19 patients with COVID-19 symptoms. Key pieces of information from RT-PCR test data results by the Israeli ministry of health publicly available have been distilled, preprocessed, and then used to train our prediction model. The model is trained on eight features, out of which five are the primary clinical symptoms of this fatal virus: cough, sore throat, fever, headache, breath shortness; and the other three features are gender, test indication, and age. Machine learning models can be considered for COVID-19 testing, especially when resources are limited. We have achieved highly accurate results in COVID-19 prediction with our prediction model.

To protect ourselves from getting infected, we need to follow certain precautions. One such safety measures are wearing a face mask. Viruses spread from one person to other respiratory droplets. When an infected person talks, shouts, sneezes or coughs, the droplets land in the mouth or nose of other people who are nearby. So, wearing a face mask over nose and mouth acts as a barrier for preventing the transmission of respiratory droplets. But many people ignore wearing a mask in public areas. It is good to have a system to identify people without masks in public places. This system, when integrated with embedded systems ensures the public safely. Our project aims to detect the people without masks on a video by developing a machine learning algorithm which identifies the person without a face mask. Machine learning is one of the techniques of Artificial Intelligence which is used for extracting valuable knowledge from large databases[1].

COVID-19 incubates in a patient for 7 days before symptoms manifest. The identification of the presence of COVID-19 is challenging as its symptoms are similar to influenza symptoms such as cough, cold, runny nose, and chills. COVID-19 affects human speech sub-systems involved in respiration, phonation, and articulation. We propose a deep anomaly detection framework for passive, speech-based detection of COVID-related anomalies in voice samples of COVID-19 affected individuals. The low percentage of positive cases and extreme imbalance in available COVID audio datasets present a challenge to machine learning classifiers but create an opportunity to utilize anomaly detection techniques. We investigate COVID detection from audio using various types of deep anomaly detectors and convolutional autoencoders. Contrastive loss methods are also explored to force our models to learn discrepancies between COVID and non-COVID cough data representations. In contrast with prior work that controlled data collection, our work focuses on crowdsourced datasets that are true representatives of the general population. In rigorous evaluation, the variational autoencoder with the elliptic envelope as the anomaly detector analyzing Mel Filterbanks audio representations performed best with an AUC of 0.65, outperforming the state of the art.","","978-1-6654-1685-6","10.1109/ICDH52753.2021.00023","DARPA(grant numbers:FA8750-18-2-0077); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9581238","Convolutional Autoencoder;Variational Autoen-coder;Contrastive Learning;COVID-19;Anomaly detection;Cough","COVID-19;Training;Learning systems;Sociology;MIMICs;Nose;Influenza","audio signal processing;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;epidemics;feature extraction;medical signal processing;patient diagnosis;signal classification;signal representation;speech processing","deep learning anomaly detection;COVID audio datasets;COVID-19 detection;cough data representations;passive speech based detection;infectious disease;SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus;machine learning classifiers;convolutional autoencoders;contrastive loss methods;mel filterbanks audio representations","","","","38","IEEE","8 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They might not show any observable symptoms like the symptomatic subjects, but they may differ from uninfected ones in the way they cough. These differences in the coughing sounds are minute and indiscernible to the human ear, however, these can be captured using machine learning models. In this paper, we present a deep learning approach to analyze the acoustic dataset provided in Track 1 of the DiCOVA 2021 Challenge containing cough sound recordings belonging to both COVID-19 positive and negative examples. To perform the classification we propose a ConvNet model. It achieved an AUC score percentage of 72.23 on a blind test set provided in the challenge for an unbiased evaluation of the models. Moreover, the ConvNet model incorporated with Data Augmentation further increased the AUC score percentage from 72.23 to 87.07.

Recognizing respiratory distress from data pooled from accelerometers and other sensors common in phones/wearables can be a useful tool in tracking diseases in larger populations. However, detecting low-/medium-intensity coughs, which are a precursor to influenza/Covid, are harder to detect in the presence of human activity especially walking. In this letter, we study spectrum-spread features of triaxial accelerometer signals measured from the human torso during coughs. In particular, we analyze the vestigial sideband like spurs that cough-induced motion of the torso produces alongside walking signal between 0.2 and 2 Hz and propose the use of its spectral spread square metric in discerning coughs during walking action in test subjects of different sizes. Unlike prior works on time-domain measurements or spectral summation (units: g) in multiple bands, this work uses bandwidth, i.e., spectrum-spread features of acceleration signals (units: Hz2) to detect low to medium intensity coughs from a single accelerometer worn on the chest or shirt pocket or stomach. Acceleration signals measured at these points in five test subjects of varying heights, age, and weight show its median square spectral spread increase prominently along Y (up-down) and Z axes (front-back) from between 0.016–0.0167 Hz2 to between 0.023–0.026 Hz2 with a cough-detection threshold observed at 0.02 Hz2 for all axes. Using a machine learning (ML) classification model with these spectral spread features results in cough detection accuracy of 92.5, 92.2, and 91.5% with k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and 94.3, 96.1, and 93.6% using Support Vector Machine (SVM) ML models for all three torso points especially shirt pocket where phones are commonly worn.","2475-1472","","10.1109/LSENS.2021.3133887","CMC Microsystems; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Alberta Innovates; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9645328","Sensor applications;accelerometer;cough;human activity recognition;kNN;machine learning (ML);sensor;smart phone;SVM","Accelerometers;Legged locomotion;Torso;Stomach;Sensors;Time-domain analysis;Harmonic analysis","","","","","","11","IEEE","10 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The study of the virus’s effects on pregnant mothers and neonatal is now a concerning issue globally among civilians and public health workers considering how the virus will affect the mother and the neonate’s health. This paper aims to develop a predictive model to estimate the possibility of death for a COVID-diagnosed mother based on documented symptoms: dyspnea, cough, rhinorrhea, arthralgia, and the diagnosis of pneumonia. The machine learning models that have been used in our study are support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, and artificial neural network. The models have provided impressive results and can accurately predict the mortality of pregnant mother’s with a given input. The precision rate for 3 models(ANN, Gradient Boost, Random Forest) is 100% The highest accuracy score(Gradient Boosting, ANN) is 95%, highest recall(Support Vector Machine) is 92.75% and highest f1 score(Gradient Boosting, ANN) is 94.66%. Due to the accuracy of the model, pregnant mother can expect immediate medical treatment based on their possibility of death due to the virus.

The different phases of WE and DE are observed from their time-domain signals, indicating the operation of the glottis. The wavelet analysis of WE shows a frequency spread due to the turbulence in the respiratory tract. The complex network features namely degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, transitivity, graph density and graph entropy not only distinguish WE and DE but also reveal the associated airflow dynamics. A better distinguishability between WE and DE is obtained through the supervised machine learning techniques (MLTs)—quadratic support vector machine and neural net pattern recognition (NN), when compared to the unsupervised MLT, principal component analysis.

This virus causes severe respiratory disease in those who are afflicted. Symptoms such as fever, dry cough, and exhaustion can be used to identify this virus.These symptoms, on the other hand, are comparable to those of other viral or respiratory illnesses. There is no quick method to tell whether or not someone has been exposed to the virus.. To counter the aforementioned constraints, a quicker diagnosis is desired, which brings us to the study’s goal: to develop a diagnostic approach that incorporates previous data, mostly from COVID-19, as well as data-sets from other respiratory disorders. Deep learning models will be used to evaluate the data sets we’ve gathered, helping us to make more accurate and efficient decisions. convolutional Neural Network models such as VGG 19, Inception v3, MobileNet V2, and ResNet 50 are among the Deep Neural Network models we plan to deploy. These four models have been pre-trained to categorize CT-Scan images using trained learning methodologies. To obtain faster and more accurate answers, the outcomes of each model are compared among the models. A ""Hybrid"" model built of Convolutional Neural Network and a Support Vector Machine is also proposed in this research. The Hybrid Model is not as deep as the pre-trained models, but it is as accurate.

In the end of 2019,new global disease was found called as coronavirus and it is also named as COVID-19. The main origin of this global virus is began in Wuhan (China) approximately in December 2019,and after sometime this virus is spread globally, specially in nearby countries of china[1]. The first COVID-19 positive patient was found in India 30 January 2020[1], and over the time virus was spread all over the India, and till date total number of cases in India is 10.4 Million and from this number of recovered cases are 10 Million and death cases are 151 Thousand[2] [3]. The way these global virus has badly affected the physical health of the people, the same way it has affected the mental health of people, that is the main reason of this study. In some cases early detection of COVID-19 is possible because there was common symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat and shortness of breath and in some of the cases symptoms are not visible. COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. Over a period the number of COVID-19 cases increased across the world as a corona virus is spreading rapidly it create stress and fear, so because of this uncertain situations are happened globally. Front line COVID-19 warriors and other essential workers face many challenges while they work to keep us safe and maintain services also social distancing and lockdown restrictions have badly affected mental health of the people.[4]The main aim of this research paper is to examine mental health after the COVID-19.It's important to understand the immediate and eternal impact of this pandemic on the people's mental health because normal lifestyle as a before will not come back until we get vaccine for it. Nowadays Mental health is one of the most important thing but no one gives proper attention towards it so it has become a topic of more concern. Also it focuses mental health awareness by demonstrating on areas of diagnosis, treatment and support, research etc so that people can recover through it and understand itsokaynottobeokay.","","978-1-6654-0341-2","10.1109/ISCON52037.2021.9702414","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9702414","COVID-19;Pandemic;Social distancing;Lockdown restrictions;Methodology","COVID-19;Machine learning algorithms;Pandemics;Infectious diseases;Mental health;Social factors;Coronaviruses","cognition;diseases;microorganisms;patient diagnosis","corona virus;line COVID-19 warriors;mental health awareness;COVID-19 pandemic;coronavirus;global virus;COVID-19 positive patient;death cases;social distancing;mental health","","","","13","IEEE","14 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The COVID-19 main symptoms are fever, sore throat, tiredness, and cough, which are quite similar to flu, cold, and allergic rhinitis symptoms. COVID, flu, allergic rhinitis, and cold are all caused by respiratory attacking viruses, and they transmit in the same way by droplets and contacting surfaces and bodies. Thereby, it becomes an urgent need for physicians and healthcare providers to differentiate between each case of the four diseases of cold, flu, allergic rhinitis, and COVID-19. Making an accurate diagnosis in a timely manner, maintain that the patient has the best chance to get to the best clinical outcome. Thus, to meet this aim, the current paper used a publicly available symptoms dataset and applied the Apriori algorithms to extract the most important rules between the symptoms. Furthermore, six classifying algorithms were used to predict the type of disease from its’ symptoms, these algorithms namely; Bagging, Random Forest, Extra Trees, Ada Boost, Stochastic gradient boosting, and voting ensemble. The experiments show that the voting ensemble algorithm achieved the highest classification testing accuracy (about 96.22%). As a conclusion, we conclude by demonstrating that using an ensemble technique may greatly increase classification accuracy and make COVID-19 easier to distinguish from other similar diseases. For the medical sector and the healthcare business, our results have significant theoretical and practical consequences.","2573-3346","978-1-6654-8097-0","10.1109/ICICS55353.2022.9811206","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9811206","Machine Learning;Flu;COVID-19;Influenza;Allergy","COVID-19;Medical services;Prediction algorithms;Boosting;Classification algorithms;Task analysis;Random forests","data mining;decision trees;diseases;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;patient diagnosis;pattern classification","machine learning approaches;upper respiratory tract;early December 2019;COVID-19 main symptoms;allergic rhinitis symptoms;respiratory attacking viruses;droplets;contacting surfaces;publicly available symptoms dataset;voting ensemble algorithm","","","","41","IEEE","4 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Commercialized rapid antigen self-tests proved they cannot handle the most demanding periods, lacking availability and leading to cost rises. Thus, developing a non-invasive, costless, and more decentralized technology capable of giving people feedback about the COVID-19 infection probability would fill these gaps. This paper explores a sound-based analysis of vocal and respiratory audio data to achieve that objective. This work presents a modular data-centric Machine Learning pipeline for COVID-19 identification from voice and respiratory audio samples. Signals are processed to extract and classify relevant segments that contain informative events, such as coughing or breathing. Temporal, amplitude, spectral, cepstral, and phonetic features are extracted from audio along with available metadata for COVID-19 identification. Audio augmentation and data balancing techniques are used to mitigate class disproportionality. The open-access Coswara and COVID-19 Sounds datasets were used to test the performance of the proposed architecture. Obtained sensitivity scores ranged from 60.00% to 80.00% in Coswara and from 51.43% to 77.14% in COVID-19 Sounds. Although previous works report higher accuracy on COVID-19 detection, this research focused on a data-centric approach by validating the quality of the samples, segmenting the speech events, and exploring interpretable features with physiological meaning.

Increase in the number of COVID19 cases has laid a huge burden on the healthcare system in identifying, analysing, and treating. Infection of this disease is developed in various stages from mild to severe, where, treatment also varies based on these stages. People are panic that even with simple cough, fever and viral infection, assume to be COVID19 and rush to hospitals for treatment. This situation leads to a crucial condition for hospitals in treating patients with severe infection and emergency cases. To avoid such situation, patients must be categorized into three different groups based on their severity, before coming to hospital. As the number of waves and COVID19 cases are increasing, manual categorization of patients based on their severity becomes less possible. One of the fastest and optimal solution is to use machine learning approach. A clustering technique could be used categorize the dataset.","","978-1-6654-2691-6","10.1109/i-PACT52855.2021.9696697","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9696697","Machine learning;Clustering;K-Means clustering algorithm;machine learning life cycle","COVID-19;Computers;Technological innovation;Machine learning algorithms;Hospitals;Clustering algorithms;Machine learning","diseases;epidemics;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;patient treatment;pattern clustering","machine learning;cough;disease;healthcare system;hospital;viral infection;fever;k-means clustering algorithm;COVID19 dataset","","","","31","IEEE","8 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This virus can be transmitted to other humans primarily through respiratory secretions when an infected person coughs or talks. To avoid human to human transmission of this pandemic, the government extend the state of emergency policies which cause vital damage for many business sections worldwide including educational institution. Many schools decide to let the students learn at home. However, in practical courses such as a chemical workshop, students must come to the laboratory room to perform experiments which may increase the risk of infection. In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 between students and staff, anybody entering the school must conduct a risk assessment, measure a body temperature and wear a face mask at all times. Many COVID-19 contact tracing platforms allow users to assess infection risk and notify if they have been exposed to infected persons. Unfortunately, they cannot be used effectively with the on-campus education system. The proposed mobile application was developed to handle the needs of the onsite education system during the ongoing COVID-19 situation in schools. The application contains three main functions which are a COVID-19 self-assessment, a roll-call, and a social distancing function. This paper focused on the roll-call function using face recognition and Global Positioning System (GPS). In a normal situation, the student just opens an application, shows his or her face to a smartphone camera then the application will detect a face part and easily recognize the student's identification. However, in the new normal situation where everyone must wear a mask, it will be a very difficult task to perform face recognition since almost half of the face is hidden. The convolutional neural network (CNN) was applied to train a CNN model using a dataset of 18 peoples with non face mask wearing and face mask wearing. The face mask wearing consisted of three different face mask types: Disposable surgical mask (DS), N95 face respirators (N95) and general 3D mask (3D). After that, the model was exported to the proposed mobile application. Experimental results on a realworld dataset show that the proposed model can be used with a high accuracy rate in non face mask samples. In face mask samples, the 3D mask has the highest accuracy rate.","","978-1-6654-1256-8","10.1109/ICCCS52626.2021.9449201","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9449201","machine learning;face recognition;COVID-19","COVID-19;Temperature measurement;Three-dimensional displays;Pandemics;Tracking;Face recognition;Human factors","cameras;computer aided instruction;diseases;educational courses;educational institutions;face recognition;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;mobile computing;neural nets;occupational health;occupational safety;protective clothing;respiratory protection;smart phones","N95 face respirators;nonface mask samples;face mask samples;Disposable surgical mask;different face mask types;nonface mask wearing;student;face part;normal situation;Global Positioning System;face recognition;roll-call function;social distancing function;ongoing COVID-19 situation;onsite education system;on-campus education system;infected persons;infection risk;COVID-19 contact tracing platforms;risk assessment;educational institution;human transmission;talks;infected person coughs;respiratory secretions;campus classroom;COVID-19 pandemic prevention mobile application","","2","","18","IEEE","21 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An automated cough detection for continuous health monitoring could be developed using Earbud, a wearable sensor platform with audio and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors. Though several previous works have investigated audio-based automated cough detection, audio-based methods can be highly power-consuming for wearable sensor applications and raise privacy concerns. In this work, we develop IMU-based cough detection using a template matching-based algorithm. IMU provides a low-power privacy-preserving solution to complement audio-based algorithms. Similarly, template matching has low computational and memory needs, suitable for on-device implementations. The proposed method uses feature transformation of IMU signal and unsupervised representative template selection to improve upon our previous work. We obtained an AUC (AUC-ROC) of 0.85 and 0.83 for cough detection in a lab-based dataset with 45 participants and a controlled free-living dataset with 15 participants, respectively. These represent an AUC improvement of 0.08 and 0.10 compared to the previous work. Additionally, we conducted an uncontrolled free-living study with 7 participants where continuous measurements over a week were obtained from each participant.

The proposed framework consists of three parts: a lightweight and low-cost IoT node, a smartphone application (app), and fog-based Machine Learning (ML) tools for data analysis and diagnosis. The IoT node tracks health parameters, including body temperature, cough rate, respiratory rate, and blood oxygen saturation, then updates the smartphone app to display the user health conditions. The app notifies the user to maintain a physical distance of 2 m (or 6 ft), which is a key factor in controlling virus spread. In addition, a Fuzzy Mamdani system (running at the fog server) considers the environmental risk and user health conditions to predict the risk of spreading infection in real time. The environmental risk conveys from the virtual zone concept and provides updated information for different places. Two scenarios are considered for the communication between the IoT node and fog server, 4G/5G/WiFi, or LoRa, which can be selected based on environmental constraints. The required energy usage and bandwidth (BW) are compared for various event scenarios.

In this work, we posited an acoustic research prototype (earable device) - eSense that has acoustic and IMU sensors embedded into user-convenient earbuds to address the following issues: (i) feasibility of the earables in detecting respiratory symptoms, and (ii) scalability of trained machine learning models in the presence of unseen data samples. We performed experimentation with both shallow and deep learning models on the eSense collected data samples. We observed that the deep learning model outperforms the shallow learning models achieving 97% accuracy. Furthermore, we investigated the scalability of the deep learning model on unseen datasets and noticed that the performance of the deep learning model deteriorates when trained on a particular dataset and tested on an unseen dataset. To mitigate such challenges, we postulated an adversarial domain adaptation technique that helps improve the performance of our respiratory symptoms detection framework by a substantial margin.","","978-1-6654-3902-2","10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671796","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9671796","Domain Adaptation;eSense;COVID-19;Respiratory Symptoms;Earables;Smart Health","Deep learning;COVID-19;Training;Adaptation models;Scalability;Prototypes;Big Data","acoustic signal detection;adaptive signal detection;biomedical equipment;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;earphones;epidemics;medical signal detection;protective clothing;respiratory protection","COVID-19 pandemic;human health;face masking;cough detection;earable device;respiratory symptom detection;IMU sensors;machine learning;deep learning;adversarial domain adaptation technique;acoustic research prototype;eSense;domain adaptive respiratory symptoms detection;scalable adaptive respiratory symptoms detection","","1","","19","IEEE","13 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From diagnosis to treatment, COVID-19 has posed a significant threat to journalists, researchers, physicians, and organizations all over the world. Analysts are working nonstop to gain proper knowledge in order to monitor the pandemic in their respective areas. As a result, it is critical to incorporate an intelligent system as an alternative option for preventing COVID-19-related effects or death in society. The determination of the level of risk, with the aid of various Artificial Intelligence methodologies, may be one of the answers to controlling the damage. A number of machine learning models have been developed to diagnose and evaluate the seriousness of a variety of cases. Clinical evidence from patients who have been infected with a virus has been used in the proposed study to predict the seriousness of the disease if the patient has been infected. The signs of the disease (corona virus) as well as other parameters specific to the person's health have been taken into consideration. COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease that has been declared a Public Health Emergency and a Pandemic by the World Health Organization. The virus has infected over 25 million people worldwide which has killed over 840,000 people and threatened the lives of millions more. COVID-19 is characterized by a dry cough, sore throat, and ahigh temperature. It is critical to find quick and accurate results for Covid-19 at this time in order to stop it in its early stages and avoid it from being a problem. Deep learning concepts are being used to analyze and classify symptoms from radiograph images. Chest radiographs are one of the early screening tests to assess the onset of disease since the infection seriously affects the lungs. In this proposal, we used a recurrent neural network model combined with a multilevel thresholding technique to detect Corona virus. One of the machine learning techniques for prediction is the RNN model. A Recurrent Neural Network is used to decide if the given images belong to Covid-19 during the classification process. This implementation is based on a publicly available dataset of radiograph images.","","978-1-6654-1571-2","10.1109/ICOEI51242.2021.9452950","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9452950","Covid-19 Detection;Neural Network;Recurrent Neural Network;Radio graphic images;Machine Learning;Artificial Intelligence;LSTM'S;Convolution Neural Network;CT Scans;X-Rays","COVID-19;Radiography;Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Recurrent neural networks;Pandemics;Organizations","diagnostic radiography;diseases;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);lung;medical computing;medical image processing;recurrent neural nets","Corona virus detection;radiograph images;COVID-19;disease;recurrent neural network;Corona virus classification;RNN;machine learning;screening tests;multilevel thresholding;World Health Organization;public health emergency;pandemic;deep learning;artificial intelligence","","2","","17","IEEE","21 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Healthcare providers are overwhelmed with hospitals' beds being occupied and concerned about well being of visiting patients in need of regular checkups. Hence, innovative mobile-based healthcare solutions are needed. This work named Qurra or in Arabic presents a real-time solution that uses pre-trained built-in machine learning (ML)-models on mobile devices for convenient health checkups. The Qurra application operates by sampling data from various mobile sensors and uses the sampled data as input to different machine learning modules to produce a meaningful health diagnosis. The developed modules are the heart rate and cough detection. These modules are the focus of this paper. The approach used in this work relies on externally ML- based trained models that are ported to the application. Then, sensory inputs are tested against these pre-trained models, locally computed and analyzed on the mobile phone. The results are displayed to the user in real-time.

Moreover, the death toll and individuals affected by lung infections have skyrocketed after the contagious COVID-19 outbreak in 2019 December in Wuhan China. The Big Data revolution has increased the number of labelled and analyzed x-ray image data in the medical field, which has triggered more solutions for preventive and early diagnostics measures in the area. However contagious nature of COVID-19 makes it unsafe for medical practitioners despite the use of preventive gear and the varying examination skills of radiologists generates a biased result with different x-rays. Employing Deep Neural Network-based methodologies would help overcome the current issue. In this paper, we have compared the performance of pre-trained models Resnet18, Resnet50 and the fusion of the two Resnet models using transfer learning. We have performed cross-validation of 5 folds with 25 epochs for each fold to obtain the optimal metrics performance for all three models. Average accuracy, precision, f1-score and recall of 88.75%, 89.89%, 88.75% and 88.66% was reported for resnet18 respectively while Resnet50 yield 90.25%, 90.26%, 90.25% and 90.24% for the same. The proposed fusion model gave increased performance metrics with an accuracy of 95.75%, precision of 95.89%, recall of 95.75% and an f-1 score of 95.75%.","","978-1-6654-9602-5","10.1109/COM-IT-CON54601.2022.9850759","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9850759","Big Data;Deep Neural Network;COVID-19;X-ray","COVID-19;Computational modeling;Lung;Predictive models;Big Data;Data models;X-ray imaging","Big Data;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;epidemics;lung;medical image processing;microorganisms","transfer learning;cross-validation;optimal metrics performance;performance metrics;Resnet fusion model;multiclass classification;chest x-rays;lung diseases;chronic lung infections;unhygienic living conditions;unhealthy habits;contagious COVID-19 outbreak;Wuhan China;Big Data revolution;x-ray image data;medical field;preventive diagnostics measures;contagious nature;medical practitioners;deep neural network-based methodologies;inter-species virus-bacterial transmission","","","","25","IEEE","15 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Early light signs such as fever and nonproductive cough give a chance for early detection of disease and appropriate treatment. Imaging features that can be obtained using computed tomography (CT) images are of the most significant aspects of COVID-19 for screening, examination, therapy evaluation, and follow-up. This paper proposes an intelligent method for early detection of COVID-19 based on CT images and deep neural networks. In the developed method, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for automatic feature extraction from CT images and long-short term memory (LSTM) is used for final classification. Moreover, the Harris hawk optimization (HHO) algorithm is implemented for finding the best possible value of internal parameters of CNN and LSTM, such as the number of convolution/pooling layers, size, and the number of convolution kernels with the aim of increasing the classification accuracy. The developed method tested on data collected in Mashi Daneshvari Hospital in Iran.

It enables timely intervention to reduce the likelihood of uncontrollable massive virus spread. In this research, we propose to leverage the ubiquitous wearable devices to develop a wearable crowdsource system to monitor respiratory symptoms such as cough and fever. Wearable devices nowadays can directly and non-intrusively measure people's vital signs in real time with a variety of sensors embedded. We collect the data from wearable devices and develop machine learning algorithms to analyze the data for respiratory symptom monitoring and early warning. In particular, we focus on cough detection through multi-source data fusion (e.g., accelerometer amplitude and microphone audio). Preliminary results show that our algorithms result in higher detection accuracy and less false positives with the lowest use of computing resources. This research potentially transforms the way pandemic early warning is implemented and the way we respond to public health crises in the years to come.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.011.2000718","National Research Foundation (NRF)(grant numbers:NRF2015ENC_GBI-CRD001-012,BSEWWT2017_2_06); Nanyang Technological University (NTU)(grant numbers:DSAIR@NTU); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9454592","","COVID-19;Accelerometers;Machine learning algorithms;Pandemics;Wearable computers;Data collection;Biomedical monitoring;Pandemics;Epidemics;Coronaviruses;Viruses (medical)","accelerometers;diseases;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;patient monitoring;pneumodynamics;sensor fusion;wearable sensors","timely intervention;uncontrollable massive virus;ubiquitous wearable devices;wearable crowdsource system;cough;fever;respiratory symptom monitoring;multisource data fusion;global health management;pandemic early warning","","","","12","IEEE","14 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This paper proposes a scalable and low power architecture based on end-to-end Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for respiratory-related symptoms (cough and dyspnea) detection. The CNN-based model will be part of the final product running on general computing processors that can assess patients similar to what doctors do at triage and telemedicine using passively recorded audio and other information. The proposed model consists of 1D-convolutions to extract audio features and combinations of 2D-convolutions and fully-connected neurons for classification. The architecture achieves a detection accuracy of 87.5% for cough and 87.3% for dyspnea respectively. The proposed work involves extensive optimization of parameters in order to develop a model architecture that can be implemented on highly constrained power budget devices while maintaining high classification accuracy. This optimization allows us to achieve the model size of 960 KB for cough detection which is 193x smaller than the related works employing the end-to-end CNN architecture. The hardware architecture is designed to provide more versatility in terms of the number of input channels, filters, data width and processing engine (P.E.) in a parameterized manner with the target of proposing a reconfigurable hardware. The proposed architecture is fully synthesized and placed-and-routed on Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA. At 47.6 MHz operating frequency, our cough detection hardware architecture consumes 211 mW of power. On the other hand, dyspnea detection hardware architecture consumes 207 mW power at an operating frequency of 50 MHz. In addition, the proposed hardware architecture meets the latency deadline of 1s needed for the efficient operation of hardware while still being energy-effective compared to related work.","2164-1706","978-1-7281-8746-4","10.1109/SOCC49529.2020.9524755","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9524755","Audio and speech processing;time-series;deep learning;low power CNN hardware;FPGA implementation","Quantization (signal);Computational modeling;Telemedicine;Computer architecture;Feature extraction;Hardware;System-on-chip","audio signal processing;biomedical ultrasonics;convolutional neural nets;diseases;field programmable gate arrays;medical signal processing;telemedicine","cough detection hardware architecture;dyspnea detection hardware architecture;respiratory-related symptoms detection;COVID-19 pandemic;clinic-independent machine assistance;initial disease diagnosis;dry cough;scalable power architecture;low power architecture;end-to-end convolutional neural networks;CNN-based model;general computing processors;passively recorded audio;classification accuracy;low power multimodal CNN;fever;fatigue;dyspnea;triage;telemedicine;1D-convolutions;2D-convolutions;fully-connected neurons;processing engine;data width;reconfigurable hardware;Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA;memory size 960.0 KByte;frequency 47.6 MHz;power 211.0 mW;power 207.0 mW;frequency 50.0 MHz;time 1.0 s","","2","","27","IEEE","6 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"COVID19 Diagnosis using AutoML from 3D CT scans","T. Anwar",Independent Researcher,"2021 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW)","24 Nov 2021","2021","","","503","507","Coronavirus is a pandemic that affects the respiratory system causing cough, shortness of breath, and death in severe cases. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are used to diagnose coronavirus. The false-negative rate of these tests is high, so there needs a supporting method for an accurate diagnosis. CT scan provides a detailed examination of the chest to diagnose COVID, but a single CT scan comprises hundreds of slices. Expert and experienced radiologists and pulmonologists can diagnose COVID from these hundreds of slices, but this is very time-consuming. So an automatic artificial intelligence (AI) based method is required to diagnose coronavirus with high accuracy. Developing this AI-based technique requires a lot of resources and time, but once it is developed, it can significantly help the clinicians. This paper used an Automated machine learning (AutoML) technique that requires fewer resources (optimal architecture trials) and time to develop, resulting in the best diagnosis. The AutoML models are trained on 2D slices instead of 3D CT scans, and the predictions on unknown data (slices of CT scan) are aggregated to form a prediction of 3D CT scan. The aggregation process picked the most occurred case, whether COVID or non-COVID from all CT scan slices and labeled the 3D CT scan accordingly. Different thresholds are also used to label COVID or non-COVID 3D CT scans from 2D slices. The approach resulted in accuracy and F1-score of 89% and 88%, respectively.
